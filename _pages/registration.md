### Challenge Registration
---
The challenge leaderboards are hosted on [CodaLab](https://codalab.org/). Each team needs at least one CodaLab account to submit results.

Participation in this challenge is open to all who are interested. There is no cost to participate except for writing a system description of at least two pages, which must be submitted on time. We highly recommend participants submit full system description papers to the challenge's special session at SLT 2024.

We kindly ask participants to use their organization's name as the team name. We cannot accept requests from individual researchers due to the terms and conditions of the challenge dataset (DeepMine dataset). Additionally, each organization is allowed to participate in the challenge using only one account. To comply with this, you should first create an account on the CodaLab platform and then request registration for this competition from the "Participate" tab. Afterward, your registration will be approved by filling out [this Challenge Registration form](https://forms.gle/q2kXMuvomkpG73Gj9).

There are two separate tasks in the challenge, each with its own competition webpage. Participants can register for just one competition or both. If you are participating in both tasks, please use the same user account (team name). The competition pages on CodaLab are:

- [Task 1, Text-Dependent Speaker Verification](https://codalab.org/)
- [Task 2, Text-Independent Speaker Verification](https://codalab.org/)

Since the evaluation dataset is a subset of the [DeepMine dataset](https://data.deepmine.ir/en/), teams need to fill out and sign the dataset's [License Agreement](https://tdsvc.github.io/assets/docs/Challenge_License_Agreement_2024.docx) in addition to creating a CodaLab account. After signing the agreement, upload the signed version in [the Challenge Registration form](https://forms.gle/q2kXMuvomkpG73Gj9). We will contact you upon receiving your registration information, and the dataset download links will be sent to the corresponding user of the team.

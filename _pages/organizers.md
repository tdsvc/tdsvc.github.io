    Ph.D. student in Smart Computing at the University of Firenze, since 2019 he has been a member of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) and of the LHCb Collaboration at CERN. His research activity is mainly dedicated to developing AI-based parameterizations for the Fast Simulation of the LHCb experiment, typically relying on deep generative models. From 2019 to 2021, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF) and partecipated in organizing several national and international events. More recently, he has taken part of the organizing committee of the Third ML-INFN Hackathon, which took place in Bari on November 2022.
